        <P class="blog">I would like to thank you for finding my little cave on the internet where I can blog and
            display all of
            works to those who let curiosity take the wheel. It all started as a travel blog, but no person wanted to
            see
            a picture of me on a beach try to sell body cleanse tea drinks. Also, travel is expensive, heavy losses came
            out of nowhere in q1 - q2,
            and a cat told me to invest in laser pointer technology over LIDAR. . . So here we are.

            Lately I have been training to be a programmer. Not just any programmer, but the best there ever was. To
            debug them is my real test,
            and nest if statements is my cause. While I go down this new road in life, I am going to enjoy learning
            along the way.

            I hail from Trenton, MI. A beautiful suburb of Detroit located in the Downriver community. It was a lovely
            place to grow up and
            play Ice Hockey as many of the children in the community were also deeply involved in the sport. Lately I
            have grown to love the city.
            Not only is the sity a mere minute from major freeways, but the lack of population density in the community
            compared to other
            popular cites make a morning commute to work extremely easier.
